# üåû SolarWindSim

An advanced, interactive web application designed to simulate hybrid **solar and wind power systems**.  
It provides a real-time dashboard to visualize the interplay between renewable energy sources, storage, and grid connection.  
The project serves as both an **educational tool** and a **performance emulator** for modern hybrid energy systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Components & Simulation Logic
- **Wind Power**: Simulates a wind turbine with adjustable wind speed, blade pitch, and yaw angle. Includes animated visuals.  
- **Solar Power**: Simulates a PV array with irradiance, temperature, and dust accumulation.  
- **Battery Storage**: Stores excess power and discharges to meet demand with realistic constraints.  
- **Household Load**: Adjustable consumer demand.  
- **Grid Connection**: Imports or exports energy to the main grid.  
- **Advanced Simulation**:  
  - MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) optimization.  
  - Synchronous Machine simulation (grid stability & frequency control).  
  - Two-Stage Converter logic for AC/DC hybrid flow.
