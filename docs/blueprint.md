# **App Name**: SolarWindSim

## Core Features:

- Interactive Parameter Input: Real-time parameter adjustment for irradiance, wind speed, temperature and dust factor via GUI, offering immediate simulation updates.
- 24-Hour Simulation: Simulate hourly solar and wind power generation for a full 24-hour period.
- MPPT Implementation: Implement MPPT logic to dynamically maximize solar power extraction based on environmental conditions. Includes a tool to decide whether to adjust power output or to do nothing.
- Data Visualization: Visualize environmental factors, solar, wind, and hybrid power output, voltage/current, MPPT status, and system efficiency in chart format.
- Simulation data export: Save all the simulation data including all simulation parameters, generated sensor data for model analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498db), drawing from the clear skies under which renewable energy thrives, this color evokes both the tech-focus of the application and the beauty of the skies and natural air currents.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#ecf0f1), a desaturated version of the primary, that will serve as a light scheme-aligned background that allows the other elements of the app to stand out without distraction.
- Accent color: Sunset orange (#e67e22), an analogous hue that brings to mind the warm glow of sunset and solar power, as well as highlighting CTAs.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern, machined look; for both headers and body text
- Use a set of minimalist, flat icons, filled style (single color) related to energy, environment, and simulation for dashboard controls and data representations.
- Dashboard layout features a top panel for user input, a main panel with tabbed charts, and a bottom panel with summary stats, using a grid-based responsive design.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to smoothly update charts upon user inputs.
